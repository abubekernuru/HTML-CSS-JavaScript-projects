# Rotating Gallery

## Project 3 from JS Kings 10 Projects
This project is done as part of js kings 10 projects first playlist and this is the third project and it's the hardest than the two projects berfore it. the main thing that is not clear for me still is that why setTimeout is rotating the gallery every 3 seconds but i am really sure that it will be clear enough when I will watch it again. InshaAllah I will be able to understand it better.
